# T-067 — Android: voice read-out (TTS)

**Phase** 3 · **Area** android · **Size** S · **Review** self · **Claimable by** agent · **Depends on** T-009

## Goal

The phone speaks key moments in Hindi.

## Scope

- `TtsSpeaker` implementing `Speaker` with hi-IN, English fallback, mute persisted, queue flush on navigation.
- Amount phrasing helper ('चार सौ पचास रुपये').
- One-time icon-led prompt to install Hindi voice data if missing; never blocks.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] With TTS unavailable the app behaves exactly as with NoOpSpeaker.

## Tests required

- Unit tests for phrasing (₹1, ₹450, ₹1,00,000) in hi + en.
