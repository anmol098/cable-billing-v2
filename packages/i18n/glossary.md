# Glossary: plain words for Cable Billing

Every user-facing string uses these words, in both languages. Linemen read numbers well and words
poorly; operators are mid-literate (PLAN §2.1, §2.2 rule 5). When a word you need is missing, add it
here in the same PR as the strings that use it.

- **Short, everyday words.** Hindi is spoken Hindi in Devanagari, not formal or Sanskritised Hindi.
  English loanwords that people already use (बिल, कैश, पेमेंट, प्रिंट) beat "correct" Hindi
  (देयक, नकदी राशि, भुगतान, मुद्रण).
- **One word per idea.** If the glossary says "Bill", never write "Invoice" for the same thing.
- **Pair every word with its icon and colour** (PLAN §2.2 rule 3 and 4). The icon column suggests a
  Lucide icon; the canonical semantic map is `packages/design-tokens/icons.json` (T-003).
- **Product-owner review (D-23).** All Hindi here was drafted by an agent and is reviewed in H-03.

## Words we never show users

Invoice, Ledger, Allocation, Adjustment, Reversal, Tenant, Sync / Synced / Pending sync,
Transaction, Subscriber, Arrears, Settlement, Queue, Error code, and any English or Hindi word not
in this file when a listed one fits. Internal names in code (`invoice`, `allocation`, `tenant`) are
fine; only the words people read are covered here.

Exception: our own SaaS fee to the operator (Settings → Subscription) may say "Tax invoice" /
"टैक्स इनवॉइस", because that is the legal name of that document (H-10).
